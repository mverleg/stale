# Steel [under construction]



It is designed to be:

* Easy and secure to use from other languages.
* Simple to use, but with the safety of strict static types.
* Stable, no need to update runtime to accept new scripts.

## Goal

The goal is to provide a simple language that end users can write small or medium scripts in, to run as part of a larger application. It is stable, so no mismatch between script and runtime versions, and no constant updates.

The goal is *not* to provide all the latest tricks, scale to thousands of lines, or write independent services. There is no file or network access unless the host application exposes it.
